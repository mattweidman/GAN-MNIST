# GAN-MNIST
Generative adversarial network for generating MNIST digits. Following the tutorial here: http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/mnist-generative-adversarial-model-keras.html

Most .py files are test programs I write for my own learning. Currently, the only .py that really matters is gan3.py.

**TODO**
* figure out why training isn't working
